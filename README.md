# ODOT - One Day, One Thing

_One Day, One Thing_ is a very simple website generator for daily posts.
It was designed to work everywhere, i.e. no dependencies except Bash.

- Customize the templates and the CSS to fit your thing.
- Put your posts into `posts/` in a YAML-like format.
- Run `generate.sh` every day (typically through a Cron task).
- You're done!
